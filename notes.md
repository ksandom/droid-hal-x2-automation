# 7.1
* `export PORT_ARCH="armv7hl"` to get around no 64 bit support.
* Documentation gives http://repo.merproject.org/releases/mer-tools/rolling/builds/$PORT_ARCH/packages/mer-tools-rolling . This gives me a 404. This looks much closer: http://repo.merproject.org/releases/mer-tools/rolling/builds/$PORT_ARCH/packages/armv7hl/
* SSL errors https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7017147

7.2
* Where to set config settings?!
* What is complaining? (need more context)
